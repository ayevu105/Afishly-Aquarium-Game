# Afishly-Aquarium-Game
Comfy Aquarium is a 2D aquarium themed idle-style clicking game that is fully functional on IOS. The game was co-developed by me and another CSSE student. We worked in conjunction with a group of Interactive Media Design seniors who provided assets and requirements for developing the game. The game was developed with the Unity Game engine in an agile development framework. Test-driven development, agile software development continuous integrations, and user and unit testing was also done throughout the project to ensure a finished product.

The finished game is under the branch named "Anthony".
