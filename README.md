# Afishly-Aquarium-Game
Comfy Aquarium is a 2D aquarium themed idle-style clicking game that is fully functional on IOS. The game was co-developed by me and another CSSE student. We worked in conjunction with a group of Interactive Media Design seniors who provided basic assets and requirements for developing the game. The game was developed with the Unity Game engine in an agile development framework. Test-driven development, agile software development continuous integrations, and user and unit testing was also done throughout the project to ensure a finished product.

Our game was presented at the 2023 UW Colloquium where we gave a much more in-depth explanation of how the game was developed along with what features we included.
